 we are in a hot spot. 


what we know:
there should be three pages
users
devices
tokens

users page will list 
all users
and nothing else

user crud management will be made with login/register


device page will complete all crud.
also will implement mqtt for all messages
server will serve mesages per device so when 
user choses a device it will show its telemetry
NOTE this page can't add tokens or devices


service tokens page can add tokens and devices
also delete operation is permitted. 
not update
lists all devices with their tokens.
